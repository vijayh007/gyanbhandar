Bit Masking

Find ith bit :

n = 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0
m = 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0    and do & (and ) if you answer is 1 then 1 otherwise zero
-----------------------
and n & m non zero mean 1 (m is mask bit)
m  = 1 << i;



Set ith Bit
n = 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0
m = 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0    and do | (or)
-----------------------
    1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
and n & m non zero mean 1 (m is mask bit)
m  = 1 << i;


Clear ith Bit
