Time Complexity :

BIG O, THETA Notation, Omega Notation

- Big O notation  mostly used in computer science.
- We need to ignore constant
    Like :  3n+5n = n
            3n^2+ 5n = n^2
            N + 100logN = N
            3N^3+ 4N^5 = N^5

Always remember 10^8 rules

    < 10^8       O(N), O(logN)
    < 10^6       O(NlogN)
    < 10^4       O(N^2)
    < 2000        O(N^2logN)
    < 400         O(N^3)
    < 100         O(N^)
    <[15...18]    O(2^n*n^2)
